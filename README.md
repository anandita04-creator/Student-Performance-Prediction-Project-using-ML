# Student-Performance-Prediction-Project-using-ML
ðŸ“Š Predicting Student Performance using Machine Learning

In this project, I built a predictive model to analyze and forecast students' exam performance based on factors like study time, parental education, test preparation, and more.

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Libraries Used:
â€“ Python (Pandas, NumPy)
â€“ Data visualization: Seaborn & Matplotlib
â€“ Model: Linear Regression

âœ… Key Steps:
â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing
â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
â€“ Model training & evaluation
â€“ Visualization of insights and model accuracy

The model helps understand which factors most impact academic success and how ML can be used to support education analytics.

ðŸŽ¯ Excited to keep learning and exploring more ML algorithms!
